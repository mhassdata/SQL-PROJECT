SQL ECOMMERCE DATA VALIDATION

## Project/Goals
The objective of this project is to analyze a given dataset from an e-commerce company with the purpose of extracting valuable insights. Through the utilization of SQL queries our aim is to discover significant patterns, trends, and potential opportunities within the data, enabling informed and data-driven decision-making.

Step 1: EDA
analysis of variables to determine relationships and their properties
Step 2: Cleaning the data:

Identified any null values and remove them in appropriate process


Removing Unusable Data: Any data that was deemed irrelevant or unusable for analysis purposes was removed from the data set. This could include duplicate records, incomplete entries, or data that does not align with the scope of the analysis.

Update any column types to appropriate type 

Step 3: Analyse data

Run Queries to find out specifics of the sales and website ussage and how it might coorelate to consumer behaviour.

Step 4: QA

- Perform a data Integrity Check 

- Run Basic queries to check the validity of the data.
- 
- Backup and recovery Testing


Challanges
time constraints and finding alternative methods instead of removing columnns.
Limitations of data from csv files

Future Goals
Further investigation on the relationships between the tables to generate more efficient conclusions on sales and website data.
